# Agentic-RAG-ChatBot-with-LangGraph-and-Streamlit-for-SDLC-and-Azure-Cloud-QA

An intelligent, multi-domain chatbot powered by Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and LangGraph, designed to answer technical questions across 2 domains - Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and Azure Cloud. This system uses LangGraph, LangChain, Streamlit, and 2 dedicated ChromaDB vector stores to create a graph-driven, context-aware assistant capable of routing questions to the appropriate expert pipeline.

## Objective

This project demonstrates how AI engineers can use LangGraph to design composable and agentic RAG pipelines that:

- Dynamically route user questions based on domain (SDLC or Azure Cloud)
- Retrieve domain-specific context using Chroma vector stores
- Generate grounded, natural-language answers using large language models (LLMs)

This chatbot is useful for:

- AI and ML Engineers  
- Cloud and DevOps Professionals  
- Technical Interview Preparation  
- Teams seeking fast, domain-specific knowledge access

## Architecture Overview

This chatbot uses LangGraph to construct an intelligent flow of agentic components with the following structure:

[User Question]  
    â†“  
[Router Node]  
 â”œâ”€â”€> SDLC QA Agent  
 â”œâ”€â”€> Azure Cloud QA Agent  
 â””â”€â”€> No Match â†’ "I don't know."

### Agentic RAG Pipeline Components

1. LangGraph - Directs queries to the correct domain agent
2. RetrievalQA Chain - Handles document search and response generation
3. ChromaDB - Vector store for storing and retrieving documents
4. Sentence Transformers - For embedding documents and queries
5. LLM - Generates grounded answers based on retrieved context
6. Streamlit - used for ChatBot UI

## Deployment

This chatbot is deployed using Streamlit, offering an interactive web interface to test and interact with the system.

To launch the chatbot locally:

```bash
streamlit run main.py
```
