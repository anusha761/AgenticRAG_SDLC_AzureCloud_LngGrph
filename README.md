# Agentic-RAG-ChatBot-with-LangGraph-and-Streamlit-for-SDLC-and-Azure-Cloud-QA

An intelligent, multi-domain chatbot powered by Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and LangGraph, designed to answer technical questions across 2 domains - Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and Azure Cloud. This system uses LangGraph, LangChain, Streamlit, and 2 dedicated ChromaDB vector stores to create a graph-driven, context-aware assistant capable of routing questions to the appropriate expert pipeline.

## Objective

This chatbot is designed to support fast-growing tech teams, especially when onboarding freshers into Software Development or Azure Cloud roles. The chatbot uses domain-specific routing to maintain high precision and separation of concerns. It enables users to quickly clarify domain-specific concepts and practices without relying on constant expert support. By handling multiple domains in one interface, it benefits cross-functional teamsâ€”developers and cloud engineersâ€”by improving knowledge access, reducing repeated queries, and streamlining onboarding.

The system uses dedicated vector stores for each domain (SDLC and Azure Cloud), which ensures:
- More accurate, domain-relevant answers
- Faster retrieval with smaller, focused indexes
- Easy scalability to new domains
- Clean separation of knowledge areas

This makes the chatbot both practical for day-to-day use and scalable for enterprise needs.

## Architecture Overview

This chatbot uses LangGraph to construct an intelligent flow of agentic components with the following structure:

[User Question]  
    â†“  
[Router Node]  
 â”œâ”€â”€> SDLC QA Agent  
 â”œâ”€â”€> Azure Cloud QA Agent  
 â””â”€â”€> No Match â†’ "I don't know."

### Agentic RAG Pipeline Components

1. LangGraph - Directs queries to the correct domain agent
2. RetrievalQA Chain - Handles document search and response generation
3. ChromaDB - Vector store for storing and retrieving documents
4. Sentence Transformers - For embedding documents and queries
5. LLM - Generates grounded answers based on retrieved context
6. Streamlit - used for ChatBot UI

## Deployment

This chatbot is deployed using Streamlit, offering an interactive web interface to test and interact with the system.

To launch the chatbot locally:

```bash
streamlit run main.py
```
